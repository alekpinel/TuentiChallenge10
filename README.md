# TuentiChallenge10

These are my solutions to some of the challenges for the Tuenti Challenge of 2020.

This year the contest was very special because we were in quarentine. That situation allowed us to dedicate a lot of time to the challenges.

I solved the problems 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15. The four first problems are in C++ and the rest in Python. 

It was a very fun year and I am very proud of reaching the position 55. Congratulations to the Tuenti Team for another very good contest, specially because of the Challenge 10, my favourite this year, it was very original and fun.

The information about the challenges can be found in this link.
