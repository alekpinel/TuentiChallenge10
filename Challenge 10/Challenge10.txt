🧙 AVERY THE MAGE:
I'm not interested in money, I just need some ingredients
to prepare some barely legal potions. Can you bring me
an intact healthy brain, 400 ml of blood, some batteries,
a cookie and a cup of coffee?

- I used 🔦 to discover the hidden ring
🔦 -a

- I take the crown and gave it to Poseidon.

🧜 POSEIDON THE SEA KING:
Oh! That's my crown! Thank you Inspector!
Now that I have my crown, I'm a real king again.
Take this magnifying glass as a gift so you can become a real detective!
You got a magnifying glass. Use it to read objects up close.

- With the magnifying glass, I read the poem in the paper roll (real treasure in
 this difficult times) and I said to the vampire:
         LOOK AT THIS CROWN I STOLE IT FOR YOU

🧟 ELLIOTT THE ZOMBIE:
Okay so here is the riddle.
   I went to the zombie market to buy some food to throw
   the perfect zombie party. I bought X brains.
   If I divide them between 2 zombies there will be 1 remaining brains.
   If I divide them between 3 zombies there will be 2 remaining brains.
   If I divide them between 4 zombies there will be 3 remaining brains.
   If I divide them between 5 zombies there will be 4 remaining brains.
   If I divide them between 6 zombies there will be 5 remaining brains.
   But if I divide them between 7 zombies there won't be any brains left!
   Do you know the minimum number X of brains I bought?


- I said to the zombie "119":
🗣 119 | 🧟

- I used "CONTROL + Z" and the genie woke up

🧙 AVERY THE MAGE:
 It's a ladybird!
🧙 AVERY THE MAGE:
 I don't know where it is exactly. It looks like a dark wet place.
 like a hole... Sorry but I can't see anything else.

- I introduced myself in the dark hole of the restroom and searched for a ladybird
🚶 🕳
